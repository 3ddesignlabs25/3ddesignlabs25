    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p style="font-size:18px;">
        I’m an embedded systems and 3D fabrication enthusiast who loves building physical, functional technology.  
        I work with a variety of microcontrollers including ESP32 (C6, S3, WROOM), Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, and Arduino-based boards, and I specialize in integrating electronics, firmware, and mechanical design into complete, reliable projects.  
        From motor control to IoT devices, automation, and wireless communication, I enjoy creating systems where hardware and software work seamlessly together.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:18px; margin-top:15px;">
        My workflow often begins with raw ideas that evolve into custom hardware solutions.  
        This involves writing modular firmware, designing and soldering circuits, creating PCBs, prototyping with breadboards, 3D modeling and printing parts, and testing components thoroughly.  
        I focus on iterative refinement, ensuring every build is stable, efficient, and practical for real-world use.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:18px; margin-top:15px;">
        I’m skilled in programming across multiple languages and environments:  
        C++ for embedded systems, Python for automation and scripting, and web-based interfaces for microcontroller configuration.  
        I also use Git & GitHub for version control, keeping projects organized and collaborative-ready.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:18px; margin-top:15px;">
        Beyond electronics and firmware, I bring mechanical and fabrication expertise to every project.  
        I work with multiple 3D printing materials including PETG, PLA, ABS, and TPU, and design functional enclosures, mounts, and interlocking parts using FreeCAD and Tinkercad.  
        My approach integrates electronics, software, and mechanical design for fully realized, hands-on solutions.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:18px; margin-top:15px;">
        My workflow and project skills include structured documentation, rapid iteration, debugging hardware/software interactions, optimizing workflows for small-batch production, and managing project timelines from concept to finished device.  
        Whether it’s prototyping, consulting, or full custom builds, I focus on practical, real-world engineering that works.
